# Treat Yourself Tracker

### Description:
    One-Stop-Shop Expense tracker that logs your data inputs of your purchases, in the order of Item, Amount and Date of Purchase.

### History:
    This project idea originated from the desire to spend, and wonder where all this spending is taking place. No better way to do that than to log your expenses yourself!
    The theme of this was inspired by "Parks n' Rec" from the "Treat Yourself" episode.
